With that new knowledge, finish the discussion, do not make another search.
You must not mention the search results that I provide you in the answer. Instead, only mention that you retrieved the information from the database.
Remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob, and NOTHING else - even if you just want to respond to the user. Do NOT respond with anything except a JSON snippet no matter what!

Here is the expected output
```json

{{

"action": "Final Answer",

"action_input": 
    "{{
        "answer": required string, You should put the answer message you want to return here.
        "projectUUIDs": required string, If you mention projects, put their UUIDs as a string concatenation with comma. Otherwise put an empty string.
    }}" required string your response
}}
